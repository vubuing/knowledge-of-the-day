# JWT - JSON Web Token

## Usage

`JWT` (jit) is used for:

- authentication/authorization
- information exchange: because JWTs is signed, we can verify that the content hasn't been tampered with

`SSO` (Single Sign On) is a feature that widely use JWT nowadays.

## Components

JWT is concreted by 3 parts separated by dots (.): `Header`, `Payload`, `Signature`

There for, JWT looks like this:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

### Header

Header consists of 2 parts:

- `alg`: algorithm to sign the secret key
- `typ`: `"JWT"`

For example:

```
{
  "alg": "HS256"
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then, this JSON is **Base64Url** encoded to form the first part of the JWT

### Payload

The 2nd part of the JWT.

It is a JSON object that contains claims. Claims are statements about an entity & additional data.

There are 3 types of claims: `registered`, `public` & `private` claims.

The payload is then **Base64Url** encoded to form the 2nd part.

### Signature

To create the signature -> Take **Base64Url** encoded `header`, `payload`, a `secret`, the `algorithm` in the Header (`"alg"`)

For example:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```
